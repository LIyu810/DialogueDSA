# DialogueDSA Dataset

## Introduction

DialogueDSA is a dataset designed for discourse parsing in multi-party dialogues. It's an essential resource for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as machine reading comprehension, machine translation, and text summarization.

The dataset is specifically designed for Chinese multi-party dialogues and is built based on the script of the popular TV series "I Love My Family". The fusion of speaker information is a unique characteristic of this dataset.

## Dataset Structure

The DialogueDSA dataset is stored in the `data_dialogueDSA` directory, which includes the following files:

- `train.json`: The training set used for model training.
- `dev.json`: The development set used for tuning the model parameters.
- `test.json`: The test set used for evaluating the final model performance.
